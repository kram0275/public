# public/Professional - Data Analysis Automation Apps/Compression

For problem statement and an overview of app functionality, please refer to the "MTS App Summary.pdf" file.

The app may be accessed at: https://kram0275.shinyapps.io/MTS_app/

Example Usage: The user first uploads the Compliance .csv file via the uppermost button, then the Compression .csv file via the button directly below, as shown in Fig. 2. The user then clicks “Correct crosshead data” to generate a preview of the resulting output, as shown in Fig. 3. Once satisfied, the user then can download the results as a new .csv via the “Download…” button.

Multiple Compression data sets can be corrected using the same Compliance file, which is held in memory until changed; the user needs only to upload the new Compression .csv file and “Correct crosshead data” again.
