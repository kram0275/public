# public/Professional - Data Analysis Automation Apps/TO220

For problem statement and an overview of app functionality, please refer to the "TO-220 App Summary.pdf" file.

The app may be accessed at: https://kram0275.shinyapps.io/TO220/

Example Usage: The user first uploads a .txt file containing the desired data, and selects which machine from which the data file was generated (“Left” or “Right”); each machine generates data files which differ slightly in their format.  Once a data file is uploaded and the appropriate machine is selected, a preview of parsed data is automatically displayed under the UI. The user is allowed to use the slider to adjust the number of replicates per sample treatment group, which facilitates statistical calculations. Once the user is satisfied with the preview, they are able to download the results by clicking “Download as .csv”.
