# public/Numerical Methods
As of June 2019, this contains scientific programming reports and revelant MATLAB code using various numerical methods. Reports completed as assignments for CE 3101 Computer Applications in Civil Engineering at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, taken during the spring semester of 2014.  The class represented my first and only formal education on programming and related concepts.
