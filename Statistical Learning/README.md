# public/Statistical Learning
As of June 2019, this contains data analysis reports and revelant R code using various data mining and statistical learning techniques. Reports completed as assignments for STAT 508 Applied Data Mining and Statistical Learning at Penn State University, taken during the spring semester of 2019. While not officially part of the curriculum, the course represented my introduction to R Markdown.
