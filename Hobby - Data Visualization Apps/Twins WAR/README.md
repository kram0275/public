# public/Hobby - Data Visualization Apps/Twins WAR

Data cleaning and visualization project used to educate myself about app development using R Shiny, as well as the ggplot2 data visualization package.

The app may be accessed at: https://kram0275.shinyapps.io/Twins_WAR_1986_to_2017/

Application code found in the "app.R" file.

Application meant to be a quick way to view the MN Twins players' performance (as measured by the advanced statistic, WAR (Wins Above Replacement)) over the years from 1986 to 2017, using both bar chart and sortable data tables.
