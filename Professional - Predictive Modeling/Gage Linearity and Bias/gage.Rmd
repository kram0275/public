## Problem
A co-worker had developed **two portable test machines** (*m1, m2*) meant to measure the same property as an in-house system, the **Reference** (*ref*) system. The absolute values of the measurements between machines were quickly found to differ significantly when testing with the same sample.

Two models, one for each machine, were desired to predict *ref* measurements based on the readings of each of *m1* and *m2*.  Desired accuracy for each model was within 10% of the *ref* value. 

## Data

Towards this end, an experiment was designed that consisted of testing 10 different samples using each of the three machines.  The samples themselves consisted of two subsets: 5 containing a prototype material and expected to give lower values (samples A and B), and 5 without the prototype material and expected to give higher values (samples C and D). The original data set is shown in Table 1 below.

```{r Table 1: Summary, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
rm(list = ls())

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

df <- read.csv(file = "dummydata.csv")
df <- df[ , -c(5:7)]
colnames(df)[1:4] <- c("sample", "ref", "m1", "m2")

rownames(df) <- df$sample
df <- df[ , -1]

df %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "330px")
```
*Table 1: Original data set comprising 10 observations (samples), each measured across 3 machines (predictors).*  
  
Upon exploratory data analysis (EDA), a problem with the data was observed. Namely, the *ref* measurements for samples D1 - D3 did not produce the higher values which were fully expected based on a significant amount of previous experiments. Via physical intuition and past experience, these outlier values were attributed to faulty connections in the *ref* measurement system. **Thus, the decision was made to remove the ref values for samples D1 - D3 from the data set.**  
  
The resulting data set, used for all subsequent analysis, is found as Table 2.

```{r  Table 2: Clean Summary, message = FALSE}
df[8:10, 1] <- NA
df %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "330px")
```
*Table 2: Data set used for analysis, which includes the omission of 3 ref values.*  

## OLS Regression  
  
Two ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were generated: one for the relationship between *ref* and *m1*, and one for *ref* and *m2*. The regression output of both models can be found in Table 3.  

```{r Table 3a: Machine 1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
attach(df)

load(file = "tabler_lm_slr.Rda")

m1.model <- lm(ref ~ m1)
m1.model.table <- tabler.lm.slr(m1.model)
m1.model.table %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "160px")
```
```{r Table 3b: Machine 2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
m2.model <- lm(ref ~ m2)
m2.model.table <- tabler.lm.slr(m2.model)
m2.model.table %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "160px")
```
*Table 3: Regression output from OLS models for ref vs. m1 (top) and ref vs. m2 (bottom).*  
  
Of note are the $R^2$ values for each model: $R^{2}_{ref, m_{1}} = 0.8534$, $R^{2}_{ref, m_{2}} = 0.8248$. These values suggest a strong linear correlation between each portable machine's reading and the reference reading, which is corroborated by the low p-values observed for each of *m1* and *m2* as linear predictors.  
    
    
## Gage Linearity and Bias  
  
At the suggestion of another co-worker, a gage linearity and bias analysis was conducted on the two portable machines. Such an analysis is easily accomplished in point-and-click software (i.e., Minitab), but is repeated here in R.

The **bias**, as used in the domain of quality engineering, of a test apparatus is defined as the difference between its measured value and some reference value. Thus, in this situation, the biases of *m1* and *m2* may be calculated as

<center>
$bias_{i,1} = m_{i,1} - ref_{i}$  [Eq. 1]  
$bias_{i,2} = m_{i,2} - ref_{i}$.  [Eq. 2]  

</center>  
  
These biases were calculated and added to the data set, as shown in Table 4.  
  
```{r Table 4: Bias Data, message = FALSE}
df$bias1 <- df$m1 - df$ref
df$bias2 <- df$m2 - df$ref
df %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "160px")
```
*Table 4: Data set with the bias of each machine included.*   
  
In basic terms, a Gage Linearity and Bias study is a linear regression of a machine's biases regressed onto the reference values. OLS regression models for *bias1* and *bias2* vs. *ref* were generated, the output from which are shown below as Table 5. Plots of each machine's biases vs. reference values are shown as Figs. 1 and 2.

```{r Table 5: Bias 1 and 2 Tables, message = FALSE}
attach(df)

b1.model <- lm(bias1 ~ ref)
b1.model.table <- tabler.lm.slr(b1.model)
b1.model.table %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "160px")

b2.model <- lm(bias2 ~ ref)
b2.model.table <- tabler.lm.slr(b2.model)
b2.model.table %>%
  kable(align = "l") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12, position = "center") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "160px")
```
*Table 5: Regression output from gage linearity and bias for bias1 vs. ref (top) and bias2 vs. ref (bottom).*    


<center>
```{r Fig 1. Bias 1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig. 1: Gage linearity and bias for m1 with regression line.", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Bias1.png")
```
</center>
  
<center>
```{r Fig 2. Bias 2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig. 2: Gage linearity and bias for m2 with regression line.", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Bias2.png")
```
</center>  
  
In an ideal situation, Figs. 1 and 2 display the bias data and regression line as horizontal, which would indicate a constant machine bias across all *ref* values; the overall bias of the machine then can be reasonably estimated as the average of all of the bias values. These graphs, as well as the output in Table 5, indicate that the biases for both machines are decidedly not horizontal and non-constant. However, the situation observed represents the next best case: the biases vary in a systematic manner, such that they may be reasonably estimated by linear equations. From the regression output of Table 5:

<center>
$bias_1 = 1.1885 - 0.4258(ref)$  [Eq. 3]    
$bias_2 = 1.0542 + 0.4612(ref)$. [Eq. 4]    

</center> 

By rearrangement of the aforementioned definitions of bias, Eqs. 1 and 2:

<center>
$m_1 = ref + bias_1$  [Eq. 5]  
$m_2 = ref + bias_2$.  [Eq. 6]

</center> 

By substituting Eqs. 3 and 4 into Eqs. 5 and 6, respectively, we arrive at two equations which can be used to predict the reading of either portable machine based on a reference value:

<center>
$m_1 = ref + bias_1 = ref + (1.1885 - 0.4258(ref)) = 1.1885 + 0.5742(ref)$   [Eq. 7]
$m_2 = ref + bias_2 = ref + (1.0542 - 0.53882(ref)) = 1.0542 + 0.46118(ref)$.  [Eq. 8]

</center> 
  
Recall that the purpose of the model was to be able to predict the *ref* value based on the readings of *m1* and *m2*. All that is needed is to rearrange equations 7 and 8 to

<center>
$ref = \frac{m_{1} - 1.1885}{0.5742} = -2.0698 + 1.7412(m_1)$  [Eq. 9]  
$ref = \frac{m_{2} - 1.0542}{0.4612} = -2.1682 + 2.2858(m_2)$.  [Eq. 10]

</center>  

Note that the linear coefficients from the Gage analysis differ greatly from those from the OLS regression from Table 3:

<center>
$ref = -1.5106 + 1.4862(m_1)$  [Eq. 11]  
$ref = -1.5799 + 1.7885(m_2)$.  [Eq. 12]

</center>
